1) History

The project started out as a port of the PHP-project OpenTTDLib based
out of http://www.ohloh.net/p/openttdlib.
At the time of project inception OpenTTDLib was at version 0.3.
When the port was complete we decided to build more features into the
our library, to make it more flexible out-of-the-box.

Among the more challenging things that had to be done other than
reverse engineering what parts of UDP packets meant what there was
the parsing of OpenTTD's date format. Just as OpenTTDLib we ended up
having to consult the OpenTTD code, more specifically in date.cpp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Main features:

- Getting general(1) server information through JOTLQuerier-class.
- Getting detailed(2) server information through JOTLQuerier-class.
- Continously updating a server and receiving notable events(3) as the
  game progresses by using the ServerHandler-class.

(1) General information includes:
	- Server name
	- Current game date
	- Game start date
	- Maximum allowed number of companies
	- Number of companies currently in play
	- Maximum allowed number of clients
	- Number of clients currently connected
	- Maximum allowed number of specators
	- Number of spectators current connected
	- Game revision/version
	- Language the server is running
	- Is the server password protected?
	- Is the server dedicated?
	- Tileset of current game
	- Map size of current game
	- Map name in current game
	- Number of new graphics in play

(2) Detailed information includes:
	- Client information(Deprecated since 0.6.2):
		* Name
		* Spectator or player
		* Join date
	- Company information:
		* Current Id (useful for removing company from play
		              when you're an admin)
		* Name
		* Inaugeration year
		* Company worth
		* Company balance
		* Company income
		* Is the company password protected?
		* Company performance
		* Number of vehicles
		* Number of stations
		* Clients connected to this company at the moment

(3) Events include:
	- End of game.
	- Start of new game.
	- When a new company manages to reach the top of the ranking.
	- When the different kinds of rail becomes available.
	  NOTE: If the server has deactivated electric rail
	  through the patch this is undetectable  through communication 
	  with the server.
	- When new companies come into play.
	- Pause/Unpause-events.
	- Client joins/quits(pre 0.6.2)

3) Changelog

Changes:
- (19th October 2008)
	Made compatible with post 0.6.1 servers where data on clients
	and spectator is omitted from the UDP responses.
- (17th December 2007)
	Improvements to the update-thread in ServerHandler.
	When it fails receiving from the OpenTTD server it falls
	back to a 5 second update rate _no matter_ how slow/fast you've
	configured the update interval. It keeps updating "slow" till
	one minutes has passed and then terminates.
	It will then generate the LOST_CONNECTION-event and notify
	any listeners. A connection may be re-attempted through the
	start()-method.

Bugfixes:
- (16th December 2007)
	The socket time-out has been fixed and tested.
- (14th December 2007)
	The Parser.parseDate()-method had a bug where the 
	0th of all months but March was displayed instead of 
    	the last of the previous month.
  	What put me on the trail of this bug was the exception thrown
    	if you tried polling a server on the 31. of December. This resulted
    	in an ArrayOutOfBoundsException being thrown. This was due to
    	a missing entry in an array involved in the parsing process when
    	I ported the the code from the OpenTTD-project.
- (12th December 2007)
	The "unreal" spectator that probably represents the process that
  	facilitates communication through UDP-packets is now ignored while
  	parsing the spectator list.
- (11th December 2007)
	When DNS-lookup failed on a mistyped or inexistant host and was tried 
	parsed as an IPv4 address it crashed since it wasn't a properly
	formatted IPv4. Easily fixed by use of regular expressions. :)
	An UnknownHostException thrown from the constructors of OpenTTDQuerier
	and ServerHandler indicates either that the address was wrong or
	that no OpenTTDServer is running on the computer you tried to reach.

5) Current state of the project

Hopefully we'll reach 1.0-final very soon. Here are some of the things
we're working on:

- Getting information on what new graphics are being used on the
  server (severely undertested).
